# DNASrep
DNAS replacement server

This is a small setup to run your own DNAS service for Playstation 2. The scripts basically replay packets that were captured by the DNAS forever project.

MCrypt has been removed with PHP 7.2. This version of DNASrep takes care of this problem by using OpenSSL instead.
